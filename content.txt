Class and Objects (examples)

### ðŸ”¹ Classes
A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior (attributes and methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

### ðŸ”¹ Objects
An **object** is an instance of a class. It contains actual data and can use the methods defined in the class.

### ðŸ”¹ Attributes
**Attributes** are variables that store data about the object. They define the properties of an object.

### ðŸ”¹ Methods
**Methods** are functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors or actions the object can perform.

### ðŸ”¹ Constructor
A **constructor** is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object is created. In Python, the constructor method is named `__init__`.

It is used to **initialize the attributes** of the object.
